        Welcome to Mini Curates. Start by picking out a category that we've
        prepared for you. You'll receive a bite-sized selection of artpieces for
        you to browse through. Want more? You can always request for a new set
        to look at. Want something a bit more specific? You can look up a
        keyword of a title and we'll find something for you.
